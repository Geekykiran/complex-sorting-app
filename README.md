# React Complex Sorting App (Vite + Tailwind CSS)

This project is a React application built with Vite that demonstrates **complex multi-level sorting** on a list of objects. Users can select both a **primary** and **secondary** sorting field, each with its own **ascending or descending** order. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS.
